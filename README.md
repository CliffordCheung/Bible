# Bible

This is a personal journey of my 4 years plans bible reading and typing. I would like to take this opportunity to type out
the whole bible. I started off about 7 October 2019. Hope that this will be my habit to keep on typing out roungly about 1 chapter or 30 versus per day so that I can finished up the whole journey in about 4 years.
This is just a personal reflection to start off with and hopefully I will have the courage and wisdom and power to keep this on..
